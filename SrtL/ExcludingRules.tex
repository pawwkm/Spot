If there are more rules that should be included than rules that should be
excluded from the test use the \textbf{exclude rules} keywords followed by a 
\textit{string list} of rule names. The rules mentioned in that list are ignored
in that specific test. If one or more rules referenced in the 
\textit{string list} doesn't exist in a syntax, an error must be issued.
