If there are many more rules that should be ignored in a test than there are
rules that should be used, you can use the \textbf{include} keyword
followed by a \textit{string list} of rule names. The rules mentioned in that 
list are the rules that are used throughout the test. If one or more rules 
referenced in the \textit{string list} doesn't exist in a syntax, an error must
be issued.
