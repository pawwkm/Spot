A conforming SrtL implementation shall:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accept any conforming SrtL source and behave as specified in this 
          document.
    \item Not proceed before all errors in SrtL sources have been resolved.
    \item Issue warnings as specified in this document then continue its 
          process.
\end{itemize}

A conforming SrtL implementation may:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate strictly conforming SrtL source in a different way from the

          of the source.
