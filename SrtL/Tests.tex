A source file may consist of zero or more tests. Each test specifies some input
to test against a syntax. The order of each part of a test is fixed. The
intention is to force test writers to write consistent tests.

Then why are indentation and whitespace not fixed? That is a reasonable 
question. The reason why indentation and whitespace isn't fixed is that people 
copy and paste code all the time. It is hard to find errors like a missing 
space. Another thing is, many have strong opinions about how many spaces should
be used for indentation. Others do not use space at all, instead they use tabs.
The consistency that could be gained by forcing a specific way of indenting 
has been sacrificed for happier test writers.
